        <p class="divp">LiFi technology will allow us to connect to the internet using light from lamps, streetlights or LED televisions. In addition to being cheaper, safer and faster than wifi, it does not need a router. All you need to do is point your mobile or tablet towards a light bulb to surf the web

        <H3 >IOT</H3>
        <div class="divp">This smart agriculture using IOT system is powered by Arduino, it consists of Temperature sensor, Moisture sensor, water level sensor, DC motor and GPRS module. When the IOT based agriculture monitoring system starts it checks the water level, humidity and moisture level IoT smart farming solutions is a system that is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, crop health, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere.            for more Refer:<a class="a1" href="https://github.com/IBM-EPBL/IBM-Project-3822-1658647256">My github project page</a></div>

        <p class="divp">Currently, the medical applications of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are found mainly in the following six areas: educational training, clinical assistance, visual impairment, psychological disorders, rehabilitation training, and personalized fitness. For instance, AR/VR can be used for medical education or surgical simulation training; AR can be used to assist surgery or guide robots to perform surgery; and VR can be used for amblyopia treatment, rehabilitation training, and management of certain mental illnesses.
